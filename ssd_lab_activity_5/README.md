SSD Lab 5:
For the Login Page there is no validation present for the user name and password. Any input in the username and the password will get you to the next page "Students Records" page.

In the input records page entering roll and name and clicking the "add new" button will get the data aded into the table below which is initially empty. Keeping any of the fields empty and clicking the add new button doesn't work, until both the fields are filled the data won't get added. The delete last entry button removes the last entry from the table.
Once the last row is deleted, don't press the button anymore, as it will delete the heading of the table.
